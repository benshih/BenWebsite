In general, it's best that you don't immediately try again. Think of the bodybuilder once more. He doesn't push himself to failure and then immediate pick up the barbell. He gives his body time to recover -- to "learn" from his "mistakes."

specialization, exchange between groups and divison of labor lead to growth of ideas
positivity leads to success, not the other way around.
Journaling about one positive experience you've had over the past 24 hours allows your brain to relive it. Exercise teaches your brain that your behavior matters. We find that meditation allows your brain to get over the cultural ADHD that we've been creating by trying to do multiple tasks at once and allows our brains to focus on the task at hand. And finally, random acts of kindness are conscious acts of kindness. We get people, when they open up their inbox, to write one positive email praising or thanking somebody in their social support network.
But the real problem is our brains work in the opposite order. If you can raise somebody's level of positivity in the present, then their brain experiences what we now call a happiness advantage, which is your brain at positive performs significantly better than it does at negative, neutral or stressed. Your intelligence rises, your creativity rises, your energy levels rise. In fact, what we've found is that every single business outcome improves. Your brain at positive is 31 percent more productive than your brain at negative, neutral or stressed. You're 37 percent better at sales. Doctors are 19 percent faster, more accurate at coming up with the correct diagnosis when positive instead of negative, neutral or stressed. Which means we can reverse the formula. If we can find a way of becoming positive in the present, then our brains work even more successfully as we're able to work harder, faster and more intelligently.

And what we've done in human society, through exchange and specialization, is we've created the ability to do things that we don't even understand.

<h2 style='text-align:left;'>Cleaning Up My File Directory</h2>
<div class="paragraph" style='text-align:justify;display:block;'>
1/8/2013<br><br>
I finally got around to cleaning my computer's file directory. It was a huge mess, I basically threw everything onto the desktop. I've decided to group files into the following categories:
<br>
<ul>
	<li>Tools
	<li>Exercise
	<li>Resume
	<li>Projects
	<li>Books Currently Reading
	<li>Website
	<li>Notes
	<li>Travel
	<li>Sheet Music
	<li><i>any current projects</i>
</ul>

<br><br>
I also had a bad habit of hoarding tabs, but finally realized that information overload is not only bad for my mind, it's unfeasible to read through such a large subset of the internet in reasonable time. Although I have gotten better this past semester, as part of my New Year's resolutions, I plan to stop saving up so many tabs once and for all. More on resolutions in a later post.

This post will be used to keep track of ideas I have for my house. In the future, I'd like to have the following:

<br><br>
<ul>
<li>library
<li>electronics lab bench
<li>plant greenhouse
<li>metal/wood workshop
<li>solar panels on roof
</ul>

<h2 style='text-align:left;'>Matlab Carriage Return for Single Line Printing</h2>
<div class="paragraph" style='text-align:justify;display:block;'>
1/7/2013<br><br>
For smoother feedback in the user interface while loading files or loading something, you might want to overwrite your loading or status bar instead of printing it on a new line. Unfortunately, because of the linearity of stdio in most computers, there's no simple print command (that I know of...) that will do this. 
<br><br>
In MATLAB, instead of carriage return, we actually use \b to delete previously printed characters outputted by fprintf. However, in python, you should be able to use \r to obtain the same effect.

Served from 11a to 130p, the lunch buffet menu included a light pizza, cheese ravioli, meatballs, and steak/mushroom. My favorite was the all-you-can-eat mussels. Would definitely go again.

<h2 style='text-align:left;'>Learning to Learn</h2>
<div class="paragraph" style='text-align:justify;display:block;'>
12/22/2012<br><br>
As opposed to traditional methods of learning, such as lecture, homework, and projects,&nbsp;I've always had trouble learning via textbook. I am stubborn about reading every detail in the book, down to the last word, but often I will either lose focus mid-paragraph or fall asleep. Something has to change.<br /><br />During this past finals week, I came across an article written by Cal Newport on&nbsp;"ultra learning" (oh, the irony). I was immediately enticed by the potential to <a href="http://calnewport.com/blog/2012/10/26/mastering-linear-algebra-in-10-days-astounding-experiments-in-ultra-learning/" target="_blank" title="">master linear algebra in ten days</a>. I realized my obsession with details was impractical; after a few books, there's essentially an infinite number of words, of which no one has the time to read in their entirety. I need to find the balance between understanding the big picture and being able to crank through the implementation (so, grinding through practice problems is not the solution).<br /><br />This winter break, I decided to try and apply the ultra-learning techniques to <a href="http://www.udacity.com/overview/Course/cs373/CourseRev/apr2012" target="_blank" title="">Udacity's Artificial Intelligence course</a>, with a focus on understanding the Extended Kalman Filter and the Particle Filter.&nbsp;<br /><br />Here are my favorite online-education websites:<br /><a href="http://www.udacity.com/" target="_blank" title="">Udacity</a><br /><a href="https://www.coursera.org/" target="_blank" title="">Coursera</a><br /><a href="https://www.edx.org/" target="_blank" title="">edX</a><br /><a href="http://www.topcoder.com/" target="_blank" title="">TopCoder</a><br /><a href="http://codeforces.com/" target="_blank" title="">CodeForces</a></div>
