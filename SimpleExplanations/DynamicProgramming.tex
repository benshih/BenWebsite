B: ``[rapid response] You gave me 11 cookies!''\\
A: ``How did you know so quickly?''\\
B: ``There's only one more than in the first batch.''\\
A: ``So you didn't recount because you remembered there were 10 in the first batch! Dynamic Programming is just a fancy way to say `remembering stuff to save time later'.''
